# CJ-Fan-Server-Bot
An open source bot for my fan server!

# Second Version
This is a new version of the older fan server, which was written in .Net, but will now be written in Crystal. This was done for several reasons:

- Crystal has better server support (on Heroku).
- It does not require a framework.
- Dependencies come from GitHub.

## It Will

- Keep chat clean and friendly.
- Provide frequently requested information.
- Collect data (with permission).

## It Will Not

- Be provided publicly (to other servers).
- Contain anything explicit.
